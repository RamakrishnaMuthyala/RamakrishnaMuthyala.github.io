                    contributed to the overall quality of our software products. Beyond technical skills, Ramakrishna is a

                    From the first day he started, the contribution he made was so beneficial to the group. Ramakrishna went
                    above and beyond creating test cases and executing them. Ramakrishna did the analysis to determine where
                    the issues were and how to solution them. The dedication, work effort, and knowledge he provided
                    will be missed by all."</p>

                    really very much capable of leading any Automation QA team effectively... He can write any
                    automation framework whatever it is asked by the client in a quick span. Overall I really want to
                    work with this guy as much as possible. I won't say 'to have him' but it is a great experience
